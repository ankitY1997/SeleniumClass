class Object1
/*java is not 100 percent object oriented language because in java we have primitive data type and int this data type we dont need to create a object because
is already pre defined and also non primitive data type we have to create an object
2.in oops concept we deal class an object class is blue print and object is define by class .class doesnt occuipied space  becuse its blue print 
but object occuipied space */
{
  static Object1 z; //class name is also non primitive data type u can make it .
    public static void main(String []args)
