	//if you want to know how many characters in string so we have to use method
	System.out.println(weekday.length());//here it will count character
	System.out.println(text.length());
	System.out.println(name1.length());

	System.out.println(name.equals(name1));//here result will give false
	System.out.println(name.equalsIgnoreCase(name1));//here result will give true
	//if you want to fetch the character so we have to use below method
	System.out.println(text.charAt(0));//it
	System.out.println(text.charAt(3));//3
	//if you want to check weather you check string is present  or not
	System.out.println(text.contains("monday"));
	//supposed if you want to check  what character is persent inside these range  so we have to use below method
	System.out.println(text.substring(1,4));// (o-y)
	System.out.println(name.substring(1,5)); //(n-
	//if you are fetching the character after 6 character what are the character is present so we have to use below method
	System.out.println(name1.substring(2));//(IT)
	System.out.println(text.substring(2));//(ay is monday)
