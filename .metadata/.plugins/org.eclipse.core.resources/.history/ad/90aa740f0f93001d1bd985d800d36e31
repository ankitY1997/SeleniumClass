//1)add(object)=>it's method available  in a collection interface its helps we can store the value.

	  //now see i am able to add heterogeneous type of value
	  
	  //now i wan to show how all value stored in object form
	  
	//  System.out.println(20+c1);in this line we are not able to add any thing because 
	// + operator is used to add same type of value and concatenate with stirng
	  //if i am using so its says it is undefine
