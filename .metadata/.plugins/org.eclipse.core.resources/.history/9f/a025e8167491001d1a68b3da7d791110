package Collection;

public class Theory {
	
/*collections=>collection is a framework which is provided by java in this framework we have 
 * a support of too many interfaces and class that works together to performed some operations
 * like store data and create a data ,search a data ,read a data and delete a data ,update a data  operations
 *
 *BY default its available in java.util.package
 *
 *   difference between collection and Array
 *   
 * 1)  collection size is not fixed its always grow and shrink according to req.but array size
 *   is fixed .
 *   
 * 2)  collection are able to stored heterogeneous type of data but array only stored homogeneous
 *   type of data.
 *   
 * 3)  Array is able to store non primitive as well as primitive data type but in collection we can
 *   stored only non primitive data type
 *   
 *   
 * 4)  In collection we can stored a value  in the form of object
 *   
 * 5)   array provides better efficiency  as compare to collection 
 * 
 * 
 *    to overcome array limitations java provide  a different type of  data structure to performed crud functions
 *    
 *    we can do these tasks in two ways :=>
 *
 *    1)collection hierarchy=>objects  are stored in the form of value 
 *    2)Map hierarchy:=>objects are stored in key value pair
 *    
 *
