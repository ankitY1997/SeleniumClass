	//if you want to know how many characters in string so we have to use method
	System.out.println(weekday.length());//here it will count character
	System.out.println(text.length());
	System.out.println(name1.length());
	//and if you want to compare one string to another string
	System.out.println(name.equals(name1));//here result will give false
	System.out.println(name.equalsIgnoreCase(name1));//here result will give true
	//if you want to fetch the character so we have to use below method
	System.out.println(text.charAt(0));//it
	System.out.println(text.charAt(3));//3
	//if you want to check weather you check string is present  or not
	System.out.println(text.contains("monday"));
	//supposed if you want to check  what character is present inside these range  so we have to use below method
	System.out.println(text.substring(1,4));// (o-a) // why it gives a and why it will not show y  because y is present in 4 th place so that instead of showing y it will show a
	//because here what will happen (4-1)=3 so range is basically (1 to 3)
	System.out.println(name.substring(1,2)); //
	//if you are fetching the character after 6 character what are the character is present inside the string  so we have to use below method
	System.out.println(name1.substring(2));//(KIT)
	System.out.println(text.substring(2));//(day is monday)
