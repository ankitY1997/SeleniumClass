/*here we are discussing about the constructor and what is constructor
 * constructor we mostly used to initializing purpose or because constructor will provide faster 
 * Efficiency rather than method
 * constructor has access modifier but method also have access modifier constructor name must be same as class name but method name we can use anything.
 * constructor doesn't has a non access modifier like static and final abstraction and also it doesnt have any return type but our method has a return type 
 * constructor will have default body and its available by default any program compiler create its self constructor body.
 * if you want to call a constructor than you have to use new keyword constructor will also have a parenthesis it also parameterized and non parameterized.
 * so lets see working of constructor
 * if you want to see how constructor will load all component than you put a command ( javap.programname)
 */
	//now we will check by default constructor so we have to use (javap programname) constructor is also two type one is default constructor and second one is user define constructor
