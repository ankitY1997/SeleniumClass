/*Thread=>thread is a smallest  sub process of any process  and multiple threads works together to complete
 * a one process or task.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * what is multi threading?
 * ans=>mutli threading is a concept where all threads works together to complete one process
 * 
 * types of mulithreading=>1)userdefine thread
 *                         2)Deamon thread
 *        
 *  1)user define thread=>here jvm will not be terminated userdefine thread until its execution 
 *  not be completed,it means jvm will wait to complete user define thread then after it will
 *  close the program .user define thread is a high priority thread.
 *  
 *  2)Deamon thread=>deamon thread is a service provider thread of an application its run backgroud
 *  of an application.and here jvm will not wait for deamon thread.it will terminated the program without
 *  waiting of deamon thread.
 *    
 * 
 * advantage of multi- threading=>
 * 
 * 1)using multi-threading we can utilize maximum C.P.U time 
 * 2)multi threading we can increase the performance of an application 
 * 3)multi threading will give better user experience
 * 4)multi threadin helps we can performed multiple task at a same time
 * 
 * 
 * How to create a thread?
 * ans=>we can create a thread by two ways=>
 * 
 * 1)by extending a Thread class in our class
 * 2)by implementing Runnable interface
 * 
 * now lets see first method =>By extending a Thread class
 * 
 * 
 * first step=>now we have to make class and this class we have to extends thread class
 * 
 * Second Step=>now we have to make run methods inside this class and this run method is also present
 *              inside thread class so we can over ride this method.
 * 
 * third step=>now  your class become a thread class.now we have to create a instance of class
 * an call on start() method this start method internally call run method 
 * 
 *   in between thread scheduler works and gives a default priority 5 and your program
 *   executed parallel
 * 
 *
 * So lets See the implementation in car class
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
