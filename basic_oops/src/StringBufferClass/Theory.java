	/*StringBuffer=>StringBuffer is another way to create a mutable string we are able to change the 
	String
	and StringBuffer is final class which extends objects class
	and its implements Serializable or CharSequenceInterface
	
	design=>
	
	StringBuffer extends Object implements Serializabel,CharSequence
	{
	
	
	}
	
	
	
    why its comes ?
	
	because when you create a string throw a string object so at that time one object
	 * is create in heap area and another object is created on scp area heap area we can delete the 
	 * object but in scp area garbage collector will not work so at that time multiple objects 
	 * are created in scp area so overcome this  problem we can use StringBuffer class 

	
	
	if you are creating a string throw a String buffer class so only one object is created which is 
	placed in heap area
	* String buffer is Synchronized so its not allow multiple thread at a time 
	* 
	* 
	* String Buffer provides some methods=>
	* 
	* So lets see one by one methods in program1
	*
	*

	/* StringBuilderClass=>StringBuilder class as same as StringBuffer but here is one difference
	 * its not non synchronized and its allowes multiple thread at atime.perfomance is high
	 * its also mutable String and its also extends object class and implement CharSequence and Serializable
	 * but its not thread safe     */
