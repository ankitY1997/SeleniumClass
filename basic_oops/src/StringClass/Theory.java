	 *  1.)By string class
	 *  2.)By string buffer class

	 *=>1. first we will see String creation by StringClass:=>
	 *
	 *in a string class we can Create a string in three ways
	 *1.)By string Literals
	 *2.) By creating A instance 
	 *3.)By Character array
	 *
	 *lets see how we can create  program1
