public class Theory 
{
/* all primitive data type has a wrapper class just int has integer class which contains some static method 
 * 
 * 
 * DATA TYPE   =>          WRAPPER CLASS
 * 
 * byte        =>      Byte
 * 
 * boolean    =>       Boolean
 * 
 * sort       =>       Sort
 * 
 * int        =>       Integer
 * 
 * long      =>        Long 
 * 
 * char      =>        Character
 *
 * float     =>        Float
 * 
 * double    =>        Double
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * there are two concept i. boxing/auto boxing
 * 
 * 2. un-boxing/autounboxing;
 * 
 * 
 * boxing/auto boxing => converting primitive data type into non primitive data type is called boxing .
 * 
 * SYNTAX=>
 * 
 * int x =50;
 * 
 * Integer y=x;
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 2.)unboxing/auto unboxing=>converting non primitive data type into primitive data type is called unboxing
 * 
 * SYSNTAX=>
 * 
 * Integer x=30;
 * int y=x;
