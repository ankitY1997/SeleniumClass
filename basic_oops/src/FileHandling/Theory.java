/*File HAndling=>file handling in java which provides many class thats helps we can do 
 * multiple task like create a new file and read file and also write file 
 * 
 * 
 * so if you want to perform these are  operation's so you can import java io package
 * because java specially dedicated java io package for do this kind of operation
 * 
 * 
 *  if we are discussing reading and writing operation so first you can understand the flow
 *  of any program like how data flow will happen what is the reason behind it what is the medium helps to transfer
 *  the data .
 *  
 *   in between stream will come in picture.
 *   
 *   what is stream =>stream is very mandatory things to transfer a data ,continously or sequential
 *   flow of data in the form of 0 and 1 is called stream .
 *   
 *   So there is two type of stream first is 
 *   
 *    1)Input Stream
 *    2)Output Stream
 *    
 *    
 *    InputStream=>when the data flow goes src file to program  so that type of flow is called 
 *    Input stream .throw input stream we can read a data 
 *    
 *    
 *    OutPutStream=>When the data flow should be happen Program to Destination file is called 
 *    output Stream.throw a out put stream we can write a data 
 *    
 *
