	/*Set=>Set is an interface which extends collection interface .and here data will store in the form of 
	 * hash table .to storing a data it will follow hashing algorithm.
	 * 
	 * Properties=>
	 * 
	 * Set doesn't allow duplicate value it will remove all the duplicate value it self.
	 * 
	 * Set implements in three classes=>
	 * 
	 * 1)HashSet
	 * 
	 * 2)LinkedHashSet
	 * 
	 * 3)TreeSet
	 * 
	 *1) HashSet=>HashSet is class which implements a Set interface  .in HashSet doesn't allow a duplicate values.
	 *           and we can not predict the output .and its not synchronized that means it allows multiple thread 
	 *           at a same time.and its performance is too fast compares to LinkedHashSet as well as TreeSet
	 *           
	 * 
	 * 2)LinkedHashSet=>LinkedHashSet is a class which implements a Set interface and also extends HashSet class and
	 *                  its also not allowed duplicate values.and here we can predict the output here insertion order 
	 *                  will be maintained and it's performance is also slow it you are  comparing to HashSet class .
	 *                  
	 * 3)TreeSet=>TreeSet is class which implements Set interface,Navigable interface ,Sorted interface and TreeSet  
	 *            doesn't allow any duplicate values and it will gives a output in sorting format always gives a output 
	 *            an increasing order.
	 *   
	 *  
	 *  and here we don't have a indexing support .so we have to use for each loop or iterator 
	 *  
	 *  let's see how its works
	 *
