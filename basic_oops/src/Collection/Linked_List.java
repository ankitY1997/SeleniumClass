public class Linked_List {
	
/*  Theory=>
 * 
 *  Linked list is a implemented class of List interface as well as Queue interface
 *  
 *  here we can use a node to store a data instead of memory block
 *  
 *  Node=>node is a memory block which is used to store a data.node has a two types.
 *  
 *  1)Singly linked node
 *  2)doubly linked node 
 *  
 *  Singly linked node=>singly linked node is a memory block which is used when you perform an actions only forward directions
 *                      in singly linked node have two portion left portions takes a previous node address and right portion takes a
 *                      current  node address.
 *                      
 *                      
 *  doubly linked node=>
 * 
 * doubly linked node is also type  a memory block which is used to perform an actions when you want to traverse from backward to forward and
 * forward to backward doubly linked node has four portions a left side divided into a two parts a left side upper parts takes a 
 *  address of previous node and bottom parts takes a current node address .and in Right side upper parts takes current node address
 *  and bottom part takes a next node address and its not in continuously memory block its placed on randomly and connected through address
 *  
 *  
 * 
 * Advantage of Linked List=>
 * 
 * 1)insertion order will be maintained 
 * 2)when you performed adding or removing operation then we have to used Linked list because it s too fast as compare to ArrayList.
 * 3)Linked list also takes a duplicate values 
 * 4)we can stored multiple null values 
 *
