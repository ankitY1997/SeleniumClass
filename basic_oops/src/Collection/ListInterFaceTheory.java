	/* List is a interface which extends Collection interface and collection interface extends Iterable  
	 * 
	 * so by default list has all collection methods 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * List has  also indexing support 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * now in list we can add an object throw a index value and also get a object throw an index value
	 * 
	 *    let see    List interface methods	
	 *    
	 *    ADVANTAGE =>
	 *    
	 * 1)   we can add a duplicate element inside the list 
	 * 2)   we can also add multiple null value inside the list 
	 * 3)  list has a indexing support so we can perform multiple operations with help of index
