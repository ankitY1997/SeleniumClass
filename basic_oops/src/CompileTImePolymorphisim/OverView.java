/*Basically polymorphisim when method shows many behavior at a time 
	
	Ploy means-many
	forms means =behavior
	
	polymorphisim has a two types 
	1.compile time polymorphisim 
	2.runtime polymorphisim
	
	*now we are discuss about the compile time polymorphisim 
	*compile time polymorphisim  means  at execution time compile  binding that  method and at run time the same 
	* methods gets executed which is binding by the compiler that is called compile time polymorphisim
	* 
	* compile time polymorphisim achieved by 1.method overloading
	* 2.constructor overloading
	* 3.method shadowing
	* 4.variable shadowing
	* 5.operator overloading
	
	//so now we take example of method shadowing
	 * 
	 * so in method shadowing if parent and child there  are  static method with same name and same argument and same return type
	 * in method shadowing method gets executed according to what  reference you will give  not an object 
	 * 
	 * now we will see  how we will achieved  method shadowing
