	/**Map is an interface which extends Iterable interface and its implemented by three
	 * classes first is HashMap(c) , LinkedHashMap(c), and also TreeMap(c).
	 * 
	 *In the Map we can stored the object in the form key and value pair here key will not be duplicated
	 *but we can add a multiple duplicate values .
	 *
	 * In HashSet duplicate values not allowed but in case of HashMap duplicate key allow but it next
	 * duplicate key s values override the previous key 
	 * 
	 * IN the Map where one key refers only one pairs so its called one to one maping
	 * 
	 * Map implementation available in three class
	 * 
	 * 1)HashMap =>HashMap is a class which implements Map interface in HashMap duplicate key will not be allowed 
	 * and values stored in the form of objects.and we can't predict the output
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2)LinkedHashMap=>LinkedHashMap is a class which  extends HashMap class and implements Map interface
	 *                 LInkedHashMap insertion order will be maintained .and we can predict the output
	 *                 
	 * 3)TreeMap=>TreeMap is a class which implements Map interface and it always gives a result into sorted
	 *             manner
	 *             
	 *             
	 * lets understand throw the program
	 *            
	 * 
	 * Declaration Of Map=>Map m1;
	 * 
	 * Syntax of Map=>
	 * 
	 * Map m1=new HashMap();
