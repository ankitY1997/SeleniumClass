/*exception handling first we need to know  hierarchy of exception
 * First u know object class is the parent class of any class
 * then throwable class is the parent of Exception class
 * then exception class  inherit the property of throwable class
 * 
 * now further we categorized the into two parts first is exception then second is error
 * 
 * exceptions is further categorized in two parts first is compile time Exception then second is runtime exception 
 * 
 * compile time exception=>compiler know or aware about those exception is called compile time exception.and this type of exception 
 * compile check at a compile time 
 * eg=>FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream();
 *
 *so that time compiler throw the exception is io exception and he says pls handle this kind of exception
 * 
 * run time exception=>run time exception is the exception we will get at a run time and  compile does not aware of this kind of exception.
 * 
 * now the point is what is exception handling ?
 * ans=>using a exception handling we prevent the program to terminate abnormally..
 * 
 * now the question is how to handle exception ..?
 * ans=>to handle this exception we can use (try catch block )or throws keywords an d thrown and also we will see finally block
 * 
 let's see the program 1  using try catch block
